>The profs have decided to allot as per the rules:
* (+1 denotes allotment ).

*  given the list of roll numbers of students,  the courses will be alloted to students starting from i1 to i2.

* anyone, who is alloted a course, is assigned +1 .

* and this process is continued for c courses(i.e. c times).
